An interactive D3 scatterplot using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2014 ACS 1-year estimates (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. The final interactive scatterplot is located at https://arieldunn.github.io/d3challenge/

The interactive scatterplot uses the D3.js library to create the scatterplot and make it interactive with the user. By clicking on each variable along the x or y axis, the user can change the variables under comparison. D3 allows the transition to a new scatterplot to occur and the d3-tips library is also used to add tooltips to each state bubble along with the appropriate metric.

Correlations Discovered Between Median Income Income & Obesity

It was repeatedly shown that lower income is associated with higher risks for subsequent obesity.
How is poverty linked to obesity? It has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts,” implying diminished access to fresh food (1). However, 43% of households with incomes below the poverty line ($21,756) are food insecure (uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, sufficient food) (1). Accordingly, 14% of U.S. counties have more than 1 in 5 individuals use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The county-wide utility of the program, as expected, correlates with county-wide poverty rates (r = 0.81) (1). Thus, in many poverty-dense regions, people are in hunger and unable to access affordable healthy food, even when funds avail. The double-edged sword of hunger and poor availability of healthy food is, however, unlikely to be the only reason as to why obesity tracks with poverty.

Correlations Discovered Between Smoking & Poverty
Health Effects
Cigarette smoking disproportionately affects the health of people with low SES(low socioeconomic status). Lower income cigarette smokers suffer more from diseases caused by smoking than do smokers with higher incomes.(4)
* Populations in the most socioeconomically deprived groups have higher lung cancer risk than those in the most affluent groups.(5)
* People with less than a high school education have higher lung cancer incidence than those with a college education.(4)
* People with family incomes of less than $12,500 have higher lung cancer incidence than those with family incomes of $50,000 or more.(4)
* People living in rural, deprived areas have 18–20% higher rates of lung cancer than people living in urban areas.(5)
* Lower-income populations have less access to health care, making it more likely that they are diagnosed at later stages of diseases and conditions.(5)
